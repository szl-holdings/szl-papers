> SCOPE NOTE. v23 is a **standalone paper / thesis increment** built on the single big event since v22: the Λ conditional-uniqueness theorem and the A1–A5 insufficiency counterexample are now machine-checked on `lutar-lean` `main`. This outline drives an arXiv-ready manuscript whose full LaTeX is completed *after* the Cauchy_ND Frontier squad reports its closure attempt. Target readiness at bootstrap: 80%.

## Section 1 — Abstract
- ~1851 characters, plain text, arXiv-ready (`abstract.txt`).
- Content beats: the conditional theorem `lambda_unique_of_factors`; the `maxAgg` counterexample; A1–A5 insufficiency; Λ remains Conjecture 1; practical relevance (UDS bundle, five-organ mesh).

## Section 2 — Introduction: what changed since v22
- v22 ("Convergence") reported the A5 structure field and *partial* Cauchy_ND closure, with Λ-uniqueness left wholly open.
- **The v23 event:** Round 13 (PR #182) lands two genuinely new machine-checked facts on `main`:
  1. a **terminal conditional uniqueness theorem** `lambda_unique_of_factors` (sorry-free), and
  2. a **machine-checked counterexample** (`maxAgg`) proving A1–A5 alone do not determine Λ.
- Framing: this *sharpens* the conjecture rather than resolving it. We now know exactly what extra hypothesis (the factorization premise) is sufficient, and we have a proof that the bare axioms are insufficient.
- Honest thesis statement: **Λ is a Lean theorem CONDITIONAL on factorization; unconditional uniqueness stays Conjecture 1, because the factorization itself is a hardness assumption (would require a new axiom A6).**
- Contributions list (3 bullets) + non-claims (Λ is NOT a theorem; no new axiom; v11 lock untouched).

## Section 3 — Background
- 3.1 The aggregator setting: `Aggregator k := Axes k → ℝ≥0`, axes in `ℝ≥0`.
- 3.2 The A1–A5 axiom kernel (cite v22 for the full development; restate here):
  - **A1** monotonicity, **A2** 1-homogeneity, **A3** diagonal/normalization (`A3_normalize`: `Φ(c,…,c)=c`), **A4** `Φ ≤ max`, **A5** permutation invariance (`IsPermutationInvariant`, a *structure field* on `LutarAxioms`, NOT a new axiom — count stays 14).
- 3.3 The Lutar Invariant Λ_k(x) = (∏ xᵢ)^{1/k}, the weighted geometric mean on the diagonal weight.
- 3.4 **Conjecture 1 (verbatim public statement):** Λ_k is the unique A1–A5 aggregator. State that this is the object of study and is NOT proven.
- 3.5 Historical positioning: Kolmogorov 1930, Nagumo 1930, Aczél 1966 (associativity/bisymmetry), Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya 1934 §2.18; recent regularity-free characterizations (Burai–Kiss–Szokol 2021; Páles–Pasteczka 2024).

## Section 4 — Main result: the conditional uniqueness theorem
- 4.1 The factorization predicate `Factors Φ αs := ∀ x, Φ x = ∏ᵢ (xᵢ)^{αᵢ}`.
- 4.2 **Theorem (`lambda_unique_of_factors`).** `LutarAxioms Φ → Factors Φ αs → Φ = Λ k`. Sorry-free on `main`.
- 4.3 Proof sketch (faithful to the Lean):
  1. A5 ⇒ `IsSymmetric Φ` (`isSymmetric_of_A5`).
  2. Symmetry + A3 + factorization pin every exponent to 1/k (`exponents_equal_inv_k_of_symm`, which composes `alphas_eq_of_symmetric` via `Equiv.swap` and `sum_alphas_eq_one` via A3).
  3. Constant-exponent collapse ∏ xᵢ^{1/k} = (∏ xᵢ)^{1/k} = Λ_k(x).
- 4.4 The Cauchy_ND closure layer (all sorry-free): `monotone_additive_linear` (rational squeeze, no continuity), `multiplicative_monotone_isPow_pos` (log/exp bridge, `t≠0` form), the symmetric back-half. Map each to its Mathlib dependencies.
- 4.5 Reading: this is the *maximal honestly-true* uniqueness statement under A1–A5.

## Section 5 — Insufficiency theorem: A1–A5 do not determine Λ
- 5.1 **The max-aggregator** `maxAgg x = x₀ ⊔ x₁` on k=2.
- 5.2 `maxAgg` satisfies A2 (`mul_sup`), A3 (`sup_idem`), A5 (`sup_comm` over the swap); A1/A4 hold by sup monotonicity / `A4 = ≤ max` reflexivity.
- 5.3 **Theorem (`maxAgg_ne_Lambda`).** `maxAgg ≠ Λ 2`, witnessed numerically: `maxAgg(4,1)=4` but `Λ₂(4,1)=(4·1)^{1/2}=2`.
- 5.4 Corollary: A1–A5 alone do NOT force the geometric mean; `min` is a second witness. Hence the `Factors` premise in §4 is **essential**, and the unconditional statement is genuinely false as the axioms stand.
- 5.5 This counterexample is itself a *machine-checked theorem* — the insufficiency is established, not conjectured.

## Section 6 — Path to the unconditional result
- 6.1 The exact missing step: deriving `Factors Φ αs` (slice multiplicativity + separability) from A1–A5. NOT derivable (§5).
- 6.2 The candidate closing hypothesis: **A6 = bisymmetry / associativity** (Kolmogorov–Nagumo–Aczél; HLP §2.18). With A6, factorization follows and uniqueness closes mechanically via `lambda_unique_of_factors`.
- 6.3 Why A6 is a *founder/architecture decision*, not a fabrication: adding A6 changes the axiom kernel; the squad refuses to fake a closed proof of a currently-false statement (HONESTY OVER CHECKLIST).
- 6.4 Survey of closure attempts: v22 Cauchy_ND partial chain (#173 fn-anal, #174 symmetric, #175 topology); Round 13 closure layer (merged); the open Cauchy_ND Frontier squad effort (parallel; gap analysis pending). Literature lever: Burai–Kiss–Szokol 2021 show bisymmetry + partial strict monotonicity + reflexivity + symmetry already *force continuity*, a regularity-improving route toward an A6-based characterization.
- 6.5 What a sound closure would require on `main`: zero new sorries, axioms_unique only changes if A6 is consciously adopted, green CI.

## Section 7 — Honest sorries: full table with dependency map
- 7.1 The single Round 13 sorry: `lambda_unique` (unconditional), tag `FACTORIZATION_AXIOM_GAP`, file `Lutar/Round13/Lambda_Uniqueness.lean:234`, depends on missing A6; FALSE under A1–A5 (counterexample `maxAgg_ne_Lambda`).
- 7.2 Dependency map: `lambda_unique` --(would close via)--> `lambda_unique_of_factors` (proved) --(needs)--> `Factors` (not derivable from A1–A5) --(needs)--> A6 (absent).
- 7.3 The wider cumulative-main sorry inventory (post #181+#182 baseline: declarations 834 · axioms_raw 15 · axioms_unique 14 · sorries_raw 228 · sorries_baseline 172): the Round 13 contribution is exactly **+1** honest sorry; Round 12 added 36 pre-declared honest stubs (Brouwer/Ayni-Quorum/Pachakuti-Lineage). CauchyND_Closure layer is sorry-free (0).
- 7.4 Statement of invariants: 0 new `axiom` tokens; axioms_unique unchanged at 14; the gap is an OPEN OBLIGATION, never an axiom.

## Section 8 — Conclusion
- The v11 lock holds (749/14/163 @ `c7c0ba17`, public string untouched).
- The honest sorry is itself a theorem: `maxAgg_ne_Lambda` *proves* the unconditional statement is false under A1–A5, so keeping the sorry is the only sound move — the "gap" is a verified mathematical fact, not an unfinished proof.
- Net advance: Λ moves from "no formal uniqueness" to "uniqueness is a Lean theorem given factorization, with a machine-checked proof that the axioms alone are insufficient." Λ remains **Conjecture 1**.
- Invitation: the mathematical community is invited to attempt the unconditional closure (adopt-and-verify A6, or find a different route).
